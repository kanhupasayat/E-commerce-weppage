            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <article>
                <p>A simple program that displays “Hello, World!”. It's often used to illustrate the syntax of the
                    language.
                </p>
                <div class="p1">
                    <p># This program prints Hello, world!</p>

                    <p>print('Hello, world!')</p>
                </div>
                <p>In this program, we have used the built-in print() function to print the string Hello, world! on our
                    screen.</p>

                <p>In this tutorial, you will learn to install and run Python on your computer. Once we do that, we will
                    also write our first Python program.</p>
                <p>Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms
                    like
                    Windows, macOS, Linux, and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free
                    and
                    open-source.</p>
                <p>Even though most of today's Linux and Mac have Python pre-installed in it, the version might be
                    out-of-date. So, it is always a good idea to install the most current version.</p>
